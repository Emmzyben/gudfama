#Gudfama plaform Documentation
Gudfama is a subsidiary of Gladius Urban Farm Africa, created to address the high demand for food while ensuring stability in agriculture. It encourages Nigerians to come together and farm in a cost-effective way. This approach removes hindrances such as the cost of land, facility maintenance, labour, electricity, farming tools, and feed, and creates more job opportunities in the country through the use of technology.

How it works: Gudfama runs a farmer assistance program, all you have to do is subscribe to one of our plans. when you subscribe you indicate how many fishes you want us to rear for you. at the end of a farming period of four months will be paid with your capital and 45% profit. but if you want the fishes to be given to you, you will be given.
